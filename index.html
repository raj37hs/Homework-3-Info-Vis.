        <p>Welcome to Inside The Mind! I created this site as a space dedicated to my love for psychology and philosophy.
            On this site, we dive into the depths of the mind with the power of introspection, observation, and reflection, 
            exploring it beyond any limitations of facts or theories. 
            This is a place to explore the mind using a creative and new lens, not a place to merely list facts from a 
            textbook. My ultimate goal with this site was to create a space where independent, fresh, abstract, 
            creative thinking and reflection is encouraged. I feel that in our current world most people are
            walking around as textbooks, just a collection of memorized information that they heard from somewhere else. 
            I feel that although memory is important, our reliance on it has limited us from exploring the greater depths
            of the mind. We always ask 'how,' but often lack the time and care to explore deeply the 'why.'
            With this website, I hope to reignite the flame of intellectual curiosity within each visitor.</p>
