        <h2>Philosophical Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Where do we get the idea of purpose from? Why do we believe that we have some life 'calling,' that we must do exactly 
            this job because it is our purpose to become this, or to become that? Our purpose is our creation. That is why humans 
            are the only species who have this idea of purpose, because they are the ones who have the power of imagination, of thought
            , of creativity. Does a bear go around living its life with some strong sense of purpose? No... when it is hungry, it goes 
            and hunts. When it is tired, it sleeps. That is its purpose. To exist. Even life itself does not exhibit a sense of purpose. 
            Do the clouds pour rain from them because they have some sense of belief, a sense of purpose? Honestly, that is beyond our
            knowing. But see the bigger picture here, which is that all this sense of belief and of purpose comes from our own sense
            of creativity, from our realm of thought. We are tied to the ego, our sense of self, and we have built up a movie in our heads
            where we are the main character. Hence we believe there is some script to the movie, that there is some climax and that there
            is some resolution. This movie can be fun to act in, but when we get too tied to that movie, it can sometimes turn into a 
            tragedy, a drama, or a horror film. We must always remember that when you drop the movie from your head, you realize
            the only true purpose in life is to just simply exist, and to express the life within you to its fullest extent. </li>
            
            
            <li>The mind exists in a boundless realm. The mind is the realm of thought. The mind is boundless, the mind is thought, 
                not the brain. Note the difference. The brain is limited, limited by your past accumulations. If we were to look at the 
                wirings your brain has, they are the result of your experiences, whether your own personal experiences in this lifetime, 
                or the experiences of your ancestors which have been encoded into your genes and accumulated into your system. 
                The brain gives you your core abilities, such as how fast you process information, how much memory you are able to retain, 
                what types of information you can process well, etc. If we look at the evolution of the brain, the brain grew more and more
                intelligent as our ancestors had to continuously adapt to life circumstances. The brain needed to be able to process 
                its surroundings quickly and efficiently in order to hunt, in order to spot and avoid danger, in order to survive. The
                brain is an evolutionary survival mechanism. The brain continues to grow and adapt given its experiences, but the whole 
                nature of the brain is that it is never complete, it is continuously growing more and more. The brain is continuously
                surpassing its existing limitations through acquiring more and more experience, and it should be commended for that, 
                it should be respected for its grit. But beyond the brain's limitations, there is another realm, which is the realm of
                the mind. In the mind, there is no physical limitation: you can imagine yourself anywhere, you can imagine anything,
                your thought can move in any way and think of anything. In the mind, everything exists at once. The mind is already 
                complete, there is no journey like with the brain.
